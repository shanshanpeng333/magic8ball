                   <p>According to records, before the Tang Dynasty (618 – 907), everyone made a kind of thin pancake with flour on the day of 'the Beginning of Spring'. People put them in a dish and added special vegetables and fruits. This was called the 'spring dish'. It was sent to relatives and friends as a spring present and blessing.</p>

                   <p>In the Tang Dynasty, the 'spring dish' was generally decorated with carrots and celery by the poor, while it had various additions in rich families. There were sauces, baked and salted meats, various fried dishes, spinach, chives, beansprouts, bean vermicelli, and eggs.</p>
                   <p>In Song Dynasty, the 'spring dish' served in the imperial palace was even more luxurious.

                   <p>Spring rolls are called pancakes in Xiamen. They are crispy, tender, sweet, delicious and rich in nutrients.The wrappers are filled with all kinds of ingredients, including bamboo shoots, carrots, peas, beansprouts, eggs, fish, shrimp, oysters, diced meat, and dried tofu.
