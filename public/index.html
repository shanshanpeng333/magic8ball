                        <p>Dumplings are a famous traditional northern Chinese food. They are half-moon-shaped, soft, stuffed pasta — like ravioli. Dumplings are named according to their various fillings and cooking methods (fried, heated in boiling water, or steamed).</p>
                        <p>Dumplings have also become a common type of food in southern China, where people don't grow/eat wheat as a rule. "Southern dumpling” skins are typically made of rice.Eating dumplings at the Spring Festival is said to bring good fortune financially, as dumplings look like ingots, the currency used in old times. Dumplings are ordered in (traditionally bamboo) trays called long of 10 or 20 dumplings. So you can say yī lóng (ee-long/ 'one tray'), followed by your choice of filling, to order.</p>

                        <p>Spring rolls, also named 'spring pancakes' or 'thin pancakes', are a traditional Chinese Chinese New Year food. They are popular around the world, but especially in regions south of the Yangtze River.</p>
                        <p>Spring rolls are usually eaten during the Spring Festival in mainland China, hence the name. Eating spring rolls is a way to welcome the arrival of spring. The golden cylindrical-shaped rolls represent gold bars — which symbolize wealth.Chinese spring rolls are generally smaller in China. A 20-cm dim sum dish can hold more than ten.Spring rolls served in Chinese restaurants in America reportedly usually have meat fillings, and can be as big as hamburgers. UK Chinese takeaway spring rolls are about an inch wide and 3 inches long (3 x 8 cm).They fill the wrappers with cold vegetables or fried fillings, such as sliced pork with spring onions or garlic. Chili powder, soy sauce, vinegar, paprika, processed sesame seeds, and crushed peanuts are added as seasonings. </p>

                        <p>Chinese hotpot (huǒguō /hwor-gwor/ 'fire-pot'), also known as Chinese fondue, is one of the most popular meals in China. It consists of a simmering metal pot with broth at the center of a table, and all raw ingredients placed beside the metal pot, so people can add and cook whatever they like in the broth.</p>
                        <p>The hotpot has a long history of over 1,000 years in China. It used to be favored only in winter, but recently hotpot has been appearing on tables all year round.There are two other important reasons for Chinese liking hotpot: the first one is that it is a great way to socialize. The other is that hotpot is a "healthy meal".Two of the most popular hotpots are Sichuan hotpot and Beijing mutton hotpot (instant-boiled mutton).Sichuan hotpot is the most famous Chinese hotpot. Sichuan hotpot is famous for its numbing and spicy flavor, resulting from a special seasoning — Sichuan pepper — and other spicy ingredients like chili added to it, which marks its difference from other hotpots. </p>

                        <p>Mapo tofu, one of the most notable regional Chinese dishes has become a popular Sichuan dish around the world. It can be said that, "Tourists who don't taste mapo tofu have not really visited Sichuan." Because of its tasty flavor, it has become a famous dish not only in China, but also in Japan, Singapore, and many other countries.</p>
                        <p>Mapo tofu is a combination of tender tofu and spicy chili-and-bean-based sauce, sprinkled with minced meat, usually pork or beef, and topped with some chopped scallion pieces. The snow-white bean curd, red beef, and green scallion contribute to a colorful, spicy, tender, and aromatic dish.The taste of mapo tofu is fittingly described as numbing, spicy-hot, fresh, tender and soft, aromatic and flaky. Mapo tofu is not exclusive to Sichuan province and is easy to find outside of China. The most authentic brand is Sichuan Chenshi Mapo Tofu. It is a dish handed down from imperial times, and the signature dish of Chen Mapo Tofu Restaurant.</p>
